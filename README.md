# Simple Timer

This is a simple timer app that is heavily inspired by the current [Task Timer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/task-timer/aomfjmibjhhfdenfkpaodhnlhkolngif?hl=en) app that I am using right now.

## Installation

This project uses [Feathers](http://feathersjs.com). An open source web framework for building modern real-time applications.

## Getting Started

Getting up and running is as easy as 1, 2, 3.

1. Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.
2. Install your dependencies

    ```
    cd path/to/simple-timer; npm install
    ```

3. Start your app

    ```
    npm start
    ```

4. To login, enter `admin@localhost` as email and `admin` as password.
